## Introduction
~[Javaprobs.com](http://www.javaprobs.com)~ WAS a website dedicated to providing programming problems and
challenges BUT I LET THE DOMAIN EXPIRE AND NOW IT IS A VERY BAD WEBSITE. DO NOT GO TO THIS WEBSITE.  


Each problem is given a solution and walkthrough in the Java programming language.
There will be code solutions for many questions from [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.com) as well
as [Top Coder](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemArchive) and other various
programming concepts.  On Javaprobs.com you ~can~ USED TO BE ABLE TO find problems by difficulty, data structure or
by searching.
